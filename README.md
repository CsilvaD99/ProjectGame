# ProjectGame
 
##Welcome to my First Game on Python
  - This game clearly shows what games and shows I grew up with as a late 90's kid. 
 ###How the game runs.
  - The game is meant to have just about the same amount of story to Street Fighter II
  - But the fighting instead of being in the traditional side scroller fighting game the fighting is done like the classic Pokemon game. 
      - You know the move name, and thats it.
      - The game tells you the move You've done but it does not show you the actual damaage amount. 
      - That is up to you to remember the damage per move and find the Meta I've created.
#Enjoy
